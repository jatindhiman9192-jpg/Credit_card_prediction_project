# TODO: Modernize Frontend Style

- [x] Update frontend/src/App.jsx with modern Tailwind classes: add fade-in animations for results, improve button styles with hover effects, enhance grid layouts, add subtle icons or symbols.
- [x] Minor tweaks to frontend/src/index.css: add more transitions and modern effects if needed.
- [ ] Run the frontend to test the new styles and ensure responsiveness.
